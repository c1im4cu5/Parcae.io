**üö® Operational as of April 6, 2025**  
*Note: This site will be taken down at an unspecified future date.*

Parcae.io is a fully functional news platform that delivers curated RSS news feeds, enhanced with AI-powered analysis. Using the OpenAI API, the site provides real-time insights into the **bias**, **tone**, and **integrity** of news content ‚Äî empowering users to critically assess the information they read.

## üì∞ RSS News Feeds

The platform pulls content from a selection of mainstream and independent RSS feeds. Feed data is queried, filtered, and normalized by a backend script:

```
/googleCompile.js
```

## ü§ñ AI Analysis

Every article displayed is analyzed through the OpenAI API to determine:

- **Bias** (e.g. Left / Center / Right)
- **Tone** (e.g. emotional, neutral, sensational)
- **Integrity** (e.g. citation quality, factual consistency)

Example output and be found at: https://parcae.io/aicommentary

Prompt logic:

```
const prompt = `Analyze the news reporting style of ${companyName} based on these articles:\n\n${descriptions.join("\n\n")}\n\nProvide a 6-8 paragraph commentary with unique, truthful (perhaps a bit disruptive) insights into their tone and rhetorical style. Also provide a 0-100 rating for Biad/Integrity and Depth/Quality of analysis. Provide in html format. `;

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-0613",
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "You are a philosopher and extremely wise." },
             { role: "user", content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.6,
    max_tokens: 1000
});
